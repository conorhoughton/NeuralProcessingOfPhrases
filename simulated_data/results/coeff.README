coeffs are the result of calculating

c_et=sum_i (-1)^i w_et(i)

where w_et(i) is the word coefficient, e the component number and i the word number, t stands for trial

the coeff value is then sum_et abs c_et


random has the same thing calculated using 1000 shuffles of random;
the numbers are mean and 0.05 confidence intervals.
