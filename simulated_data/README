the word is all done by

simulated_eeg.jl

and

get_FT.m

the rest are just test programmes.

These rely on the list of trials given in

anan.txt and similar

The folder "keyDictionary" gives the lists of words for each type of
word, eg "nouns", this is important because the word2vec vectors are
stored in files labels the same way and in the same order, so these
files are needed for working out how to find the word2vec vector for a
given word.

The folder "vectors" holds the actual word2vec vectors

The folder "trials" holds the word list for each trial

so the logic goes

load anan.txt (or similar) -> this has a list of trials, find the
trial in "trials", for each word use information from keyDirectory to
get the correct word2vec vector from "vectors".

the simulated responses go to "simuluated data"

the matlab code in get_FT.m then calculates then does the Fourier
analysis and works out the ITPC, which goes in results.
