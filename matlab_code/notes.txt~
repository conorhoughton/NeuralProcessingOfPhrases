step1_preprocessing.m

this detrends / demeans / low passes the participant 5-20
data and splits it into
trials 1-144 it does ICA and removes ICA components that are dominated
by the front channels

step1_preprocessing.m

this does the same thing for the participant 1-4 data, here are there
only 72 trials because only AVAV / ANAN / PHMI are processed because
of the marker file errors in the other conditions

in both cases trial 8 /38 / 68 / 98 / 128 / 158 are left out, these
have marker problems for P1-4 and to make the data comparable for all
participants this trial is excluded for P5-20 as well

step2_ft.m

this takes the Fourier transform; the Fourier coefficients are stored
in big matrices in processed_data/ft

At this point further analysis is done using julia in the ictp_code
folder; this includes a programme that can load the big matrices of
Fourier coefficients and split them up by condition

_____________________

The above describes the reanalysis of the data we did after the marker
problem was spotted, below are rough notes taken during this process
of reanalysis. This notes are of no interest now.


the test* programmes in the test folder were used to build the workflow but applied to a single file

the order is

test_preprocessing.m            - old "Step1"
test_remove_components.m        - old "Step2"
test_fg.m                       - old "Step3"
	
these follow Amelia in doing the ICA on a per-condition basis. To fix
this there is

new_test_preprocessing.m - combines "Step1" and "Step2" but does blink
removal all in one go

________________


note

- in addition to removing front dominated components there used to be a left
  and right condition, it isn't mentioned in the paper so it has been
  removed.

- the comp.topo object is the mixing matrix - this was for eye
  blink removal but I think it should be unmixing matrix

  if c is the components and e the eeg then the ICA assumes e=Mc where
  M is the mixing matrix whereas c=We where W is the unmixing matrix
  if c is 30d and e is 32d then W is 30X32 and a row of W gives the
  weighting of each electrode in the component, which is what we want,
  except we need to also have the power of each electrode - this
  doesn't really make sense since the electrodes are correllated so
  the power of the component is not the weighted sum of the power of
  the electrodes!


todo

- check the remove components correctly identifies front channels - DONE

- the ica and blink removal shouldn't be done on a per-condition fashion - DONE
