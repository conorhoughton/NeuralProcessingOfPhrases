This contains the matlab code we used to produce the Fourier coefficients.

It ran on Matlab R2020a and Fieldtrip 20200607

The directory locations will need to be updated to get it to run; because of its size our eeg files are stored in a seperate zenodo repository.

step1_preprocessing.m

this detrends / demeans / low passes the participant 5-20
data and splits it into
trials 1-144 it does ICA and removes ICA components that are dominated
by the front channels

step1_preprocessing_P1-4.m

this does the same thing for the participant 1-4 data, here are there
only 72 trials because only AVAV / ANAN / PHMI are processed because
of the marker file errors in the other conditions

in both cases trial 8 /38 / 68 / 98 / 128 / 158 are left out, these
have marker problems for P1-4 and to make the data comparable for all
participants this trial is excluded for P5-20 as well

step2_ft.m

this takes the Fourier transform; the Fourier coefficients are stored
in big matrices in processed_data/ft

At this point further analysis is done using julia in the ictp_code
folder; this includes a programme that can load the big matrices of
Fourier coefficients and split them up by condition
