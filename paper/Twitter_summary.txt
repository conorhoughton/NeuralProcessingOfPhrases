New paper with Amelia Burroughs and Nina Kazanina on the brain's response to grammar:

A few years ago I heard a talk by Nina where she mentioned work by
David Poeppel, Nai Ding and co-workers which amazed me, amazed me enough to
start work on neurolinguistics.

They measured using MEG, later EEG, a neural response to hierarchical
grammatical structure: verbs bound to their subjects, nouns to their
adjectives, noun phrases and verb phrases bound together to make
sentences.

This seemed like it must be wrong: the idea that the very formal
grammatical manipulations proposed in Chomskyan linguistics can be
traced in neural activity . . .

. . . contradicted my understanding of the brain as a organ for
Bayesian inference. It was me that was wrong.

I was convinced that the response they saw was a result of the
regularity of their stimulus, they were seeing the brain going 'oh
there's a noun' not 'that noun is bound to that verb'.

To examine the we compared the EEG response to stimuli composed of
grammatical adjective-noun pairs and ungrammatical adjective-verb
pairs.

If the response was an artifact of repetition in the stimulus and
word-by-word lexical categorization in the brain, these should produce
the same response.

In fact there is a stronger response from adjective-noun, consistent
with the original result and Chomskyan linguistics.

Interesting we also found a smaller response from a stimulus composed
of a mixture of different types of grammatical two word phrases.

This might indicate the response to phrases depends on the type of
phrase.

Of course, I still believe the brain is an organ of Bayesian
inference, but it must be one which exploits hierarchical grammatical
structure.

How is this related to how LSTMs work? That I'd like to know.
