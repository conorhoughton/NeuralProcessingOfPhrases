This is a collection of pieces of code used when exploring the
Bayesian modelling of the phase data; ultimately the work was done
using stan and these programmes were not changed and adjusted without
a view to preserving definite copies, often changes were made directly
on the supercomputer that aren't reflected here. In short, the code is presented as is and is unlikely to be useful to others.
