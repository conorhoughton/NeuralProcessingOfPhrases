some bash scripts used for running the code - to work they should be
in the .. folder.

range_run.sh is a loop which calls run_job.sh for different
frequencies; it passes $1 + i as runC where i is the loop variable, it
passes $2 as name and $3 as comment

run_job.sh runs sbatch with $1 $2 $3 as arguments, ultimately giving
freq, runC and name, it also outputs the time, jobID, $1 $2 $3 $4 to
log.txt. The $4 appears nowhere else and is intended as a comment for
the log file.

fit.sh is the actual slurm script
